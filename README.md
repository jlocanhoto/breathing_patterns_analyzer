# Breathing Patterns Analyzer

## Application of time series analysis to classify therapeutic breathing patterns


## Execution instructions

Install Python 3.7+ and project dependencies. For example, using Python 3.7, the commands would be similar to these below:

```shell
$ python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv
$ virtualenv -p python3.7 rda_env
$ source rda_env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, execute the main file of the project with the virtual environment activated:

```shell
$ python analyzer.py
```

Access to the dataset should be directly requested to the authors and only for scientific purposes.
